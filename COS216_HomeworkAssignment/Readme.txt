I chose to get 5 images with each API call as this means that all images are loaded at the beginning of the game
so that the users do not have to wait for images to load. I also think that having 1 api call is better than having 
5 api calls as it is more efficient and therefore beeter for the server hosting the database and api.

I chose to store images as Base64 strings as it means that the images are not reliant on other websites and ensures
that the images can be loaded fast and effiecintly without using external resources.
